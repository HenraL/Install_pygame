# Install_pygame
 This is a windows consol program written in english for the first file and in french for the second file, to enable you to download pygame without to many difficulties. You will need to have installed pip to be able to install pygame. If pip is not installed, you can use the automated pip installation I created: https://github.com/HenraL/install_pip/tree/master/files/install_pip
